The 8 week sql challenge is inspired by[  Data With Danny](https://bit.ly/datawithdanny-8wsc). This virtual data apprenticeship program was to celebrate the launch of his serious sql course [Here](https://bit.ly/3gWUT2G).
For the next 8 weeks - I challenge myself to:
Learning and practicing problem solving with SQL
Complete the challenge and share my learning and discoveries.

In this case study, Danny owns a pizza store. Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house). He prepared an entity relationship diagram of his database design but required further assistance in cleaning his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and speedrun Pizza Runner’s operations.
